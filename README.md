# Gallery of Metaflow Dynamic Cards

![](images/rtcard-all.gif)

Imagine a long-running task, like training of an ML/AI model, a data processing task,
or a task communicating with an external service. In all these cases, it is useful to
know how the task is performing and how/if it is making progress while it is running.

Metaflow allows you to [orchestrate even large compute tasks](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/introduction)
easily, which you can then [monitor live using dynamic cards](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results).
This repository contains a gallery of dynamic cards, showing how you can apply them in various use cases.
